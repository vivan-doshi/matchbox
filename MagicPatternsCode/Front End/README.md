# Magic Patterns - Vite Template

This code was generated by [Magic Patterns](https://magicpatterns.com) for this design: [Source Design](https://www.magicpatterns.com/c/eax1j9scgms6v2bub651mu)

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install`
2. Create an `.env.local` (or `.env`) file in this folder so previews/production builds know where the API lives:

   ```bash
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

   When running `npm run dev`, the Vite proxy still handles `/api`, but preview/prod builds will use this base URL.
3. Run `npm run dev`
